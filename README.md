# Arduino-fire-detection-system-with-Android-connectivity
In this project, I have built a fire alarm using Arduino Uno which is interfaced with a temperature sensor, a smoke sensor, and buzzer. The temperature sensor senses the heat and smoke sensor senses any smoke generated due to burning or fire. Buzzer connected to Arduino gives us an alarm indication. Whenever fire triggered, it burns objects nearby and produces smoke. A fire alarm can also be triggered due to small smoke from candlelight or oil lamps used in a household. Also, whenever heat intensity is high then also the alarm goes on. Buzzer or alarm is turned off whenever the temperature goes to normal room temperature and smoke level reduces. We have also interfaced LCD display and Relay to the Arduino board.
